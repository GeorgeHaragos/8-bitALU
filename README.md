# 8-bitALUProject Overview

You will design and simulate an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) of your choice (e.g., VHDL, Verilog). The project is to be completed structurally, emphasizing the hardware components rather than behavioral descriptions.
Team Composition

    Teams of 1–4 students.

Project Requirements

Your ALU must support the following arithmetic operations:

    Addition

    Subtraction

    Multiplication

    Division

Multiplication Algorithms

You must implement one multiplication algorithm of your choice, from the following options studied during the laboratory:

    Booth Radix-2

    Modified Booth Algorithm

    Booth Radix-4

    Booth Radix-8

Division Algorithms

You must implement one division algorithm of your choice, from the following options studied during the laboratory:

    Restoring Division

    Non-restoring Division

    SRT Radix-2

    SRT Radix-4

Structural Implementation

Your HDL code should be structurally described, which means:

    Clearly defined hardware modules and interconnections

    Separate implementation for Arithmetic Unit, Control Unit, Multiplexer, Registers, and other necessary hardware components

    Minimal or no behavioral code

Control Unit

You must design a Control Unit capable of emitting appropriate control signals to select and execute each arithmetic operation.
Recommended Tools

You may use any HDL simulation tool of your choice. Recommended tools include: ModelSim, Quartus Prime, Xilinx Vivado, Icarus Verilog
Project Phases

The project will be divided into three primary phases:
1. Design Phase

    Define the architecture and component modules.

    Provide schematic diagrams detailing module connections and signal flow.

    Clearly indicate the algorithm choices for multiplication and division.

2. Implementation Phase

    Write structurally-oriented HDL code.

    Implement each arithmetic module individually.

    Integrate modules with the Control Unit to form a fully operational 8-bit ALU.

3. Testing Phase

    Develop comprehensive testbenches for each arithmetic operation.

    Perform simulations to verify correctness.

    Provide simulation waveforms demonstrating successful operation.

Deliverables

Your final submission should include:

    Documentation:

        Project overview and objectives

        Architecture diagrams and explanations

        HDL code listings (clearly commented and structured)

        Testbench descriptions and simulation waveforms

        Discussion of results, including issues encountered and resolutions

    Presentation:

        Prepare a concise presentation (~10 minutes) summarizing design decisions, structural implementations, testing procedures, and final results.

        Presentations will be conducted during Week 9 of the laboratory sessions.

Evaluation Criteria

    Correctness and functionality of arithmetic operations

    Clarity and structural organization of HDL implementation

    Completeness of testing and accuracy of simulations

    Quality and clarity of project documentation and presentation

    Team collaboration and individual contribution (where applicable)
